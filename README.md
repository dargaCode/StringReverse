# String Reverse
<strong>Language: C</strong>

Reverse a given string using loops.

Short but not easy haha. I thought I’d save myself some time by hardcoding the string at first, and change it to be dynamic later. 

After a couple of very frustrating hours, I learned that hardcoded strings live in the executable, and aren’t rewritable =\

[edit: turns out they're only hardcoded when defined as pointers, not arrays]
